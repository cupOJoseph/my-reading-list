# Joseph Schiarizzi's Open Source Reading List
A list of books I want to keep track of.


## My Top Recomendations To You
- **Dune by Frank Herbert.** An amazing book about what it is to lead, the impermanence of our universe, and the experience of life. A cautionary tale about the dangers of savior type leaders, and humanity's delicate relationship with nature. 
- **The Happy City by Charles Montgomery** Urban sprawl and detached suburban neighborhoods were never developed naturally. They were laid out, MASSIVELY subsidized by government, and legally mandated long before anyone actually bought a house there. By exploring our relationship with the city through history and today we can learn to build human centered cities that make us happier and are more sustainable.
- **Army of None by Paul Scharre.** The reasons A.I. weapons aren't as scary as you thought, and also some reasons you never thought of for why they are even scarier. 
- **Walden by Henry David Thoreau.** A philosophical classic and masterpiece of the transcendentalists, the core belief of which is in the inherent goodness of people and nature.
