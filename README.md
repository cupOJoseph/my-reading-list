# Joseph Schiarizzi's Open Source Reading List
A list of books I want to keep track of.


## My Top Recomendations To You
- **Dune by Frank Herbert.** An amazing book about what it is to lead, the impermanence of our universe, and the experience of life.
- **Army of None by Paul Scharre.** The reasons A.I. weapons aren't as scary as you thought, and also some reasons you never thought of for why they are even scarier. 
- **Onward by Howard Schultz.** It *is* possible to create a great successful company while staying true to one's original values as told by the founder of Starbucks.
- **Walden by Henry David Thoreau.** A philosophical classic and masterpiece of the transcendentalists, the core belief of which is in the inherent goodness of people and nature.
